# Scriptshop

A general repository containing a lot of my one-off scripts
=====================================================================
* These scripts are all able to be run from the Linux/Ubuntu bash (assumming dependencies are installed)

Python Scripts
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* These will be pased purely from Python3

Java Scripts
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* These will be based on the latest OpenJDK LTS Java Version (as of commit that is Java 11).
* These will likely be based from [JBang](https://github.com/maxandersen/jbang) as this allows libraries to be retrieved.
